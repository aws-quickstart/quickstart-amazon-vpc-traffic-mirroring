This Quick Start deployment guide provides instructions for deploying an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud 
(Amazon EC2) instance with https://suricata.io/[Suricata^], an open-source tool for monitoring network traffic with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html[Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring^]. 

This Quick Start is for security, DevSecOps, and network engineers 
who want to monitor Amazon EC2 instance network traffic using Suricata.

The Quick Start provides AWS CloudFormation templates for deploying Suricata on a single Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance for limited scale deployments or behind a Network Load Balancer in an Auto Scaling group for highly available larger deployments.

NOTE: This Quick Start does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring. For information about configuring Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic, see the  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-getting-started.html[Traffic Mirroring getting start guide^].

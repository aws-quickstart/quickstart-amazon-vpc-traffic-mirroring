You can use open-source tool to monitor network traffic from Amazon EC2 instances. The following tools work with Traffic Mirroring:
  * Suricata — For more information see the [Suricata website](https://suricata.io/)
  * Zeek — For more information, see the [Zeek Network Monitor Security website](https://zeek.org/)

These open-source tools support VXLAN decapsulation, and they can be used at scale to monitor VPC traffic. For information about how Zeek handles VXLAN support and to download the code, see [Zeek vxlan](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/tree/master/src/analyzer/protocol/vxlan) on the GitHub website. For information about how Suricata handles VXLAN support and to download the code, see [Suricata](https://github.com/OISF/suricata) on the GitHub website. 

The Quick Start deploys open-source Suricata on either a single EC2 instance for limited scale deployments, or behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in an Auto Scaling group for highly-available larger deployments.

This Quick Start is for security infrastructure architects, DevSecOps engineers and administrators who wants to monitor Amazon EC2 instance network traffic using Suricata.

The Quick Start does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic. Refer to [Traffic Mirroring getting start guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-getting-started.html) for configuring VPC Traffic Mirroring.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.jpg[Architecture, width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
 ** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
 ** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
 ** {partner-product-short-name} EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group used for deploying across two Availability Zones, offering high availability.
 ** A Network Load Balancer (NLB) to balance traffic between the {partner-product-short-name} EC2 instances.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

NOTE: The Quick Start does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic. Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-getting-started.html[Traffic Mirroring getting start guide^] for configuring VPC Traffic Mirroring.

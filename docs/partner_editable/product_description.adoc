Traffic Mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for:
  * Content inspection
  * Threat monitoring
  * Troubleshooting

The security and monitoring appliances can be deployed as individual instances, or as a fleet of instances behind a Network Load Balancer with a UDP listener. Traffic Mirroring supports filters and packet truncation, so that you only extract the traffic of interest to monitor by using monitoring tools of your choice. 

You can use open-source tool to monitor network traffic from Amazon EC2 instances. The following tools work with Traffic Mirroring:
  * Suricata — For more information see the [Suricata website](https://suricata.io/)
  * Zeek — For more information, see the [Zeek Network Monitor Security website](https://zeek.org/)

These open-source tools support VXLAN decapsulation, and they can be used at scale to monitor VPC traffic. For information about how Zeek handles VXLAN support and to download the code, see [Zeek vxlan](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/tree/master/src/analyzer/protocol/vxlan) on the GitHub website. For information about how Suricata handles VXLAN support and to download the code, see [Suricata](https://github.com/OISF/suricata) on the GitHub website.
 
This Quick Start provides ability to use Suricata for monitoring Amazon EC2 instance network traffic. The Quick Start deploys open-source Suricata on either a single EC2 instance for limited scale deployments, or behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in an Auto Scaling group for highly-available larger deployments.

The Quick Start does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic. Refer to [Traffic Mirroring getting start guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-getting-started.html) for configuring VPC Traffic Mirroring.

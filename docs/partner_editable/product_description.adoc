This Quick Start provides ability to use https://suricata.io/[Suricata^] for monitoring Amazon EC2 
instance network traffic using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html[Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring^]. 
The Quick Start deploys open-source Suricata on either a single Amazon Linux 2 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance for limited scale deployments, or behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) 
in an Auto Scaling group for highly-available larger deployments.

Quick Start deploys:
* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 
using the https://fwd.aws/9VdxN[Amazon VPC Quick Start reference
deployment].
* Linux bastion host using the 
https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-linux-bastion/[Linux Bastion Hosts on AWS Quick Start reference deployment^]
* If TrafficMirrorTargetType=NLB:
** Creates Network Load Balancer (NLB) with scheme internal
** Creates target group to process VXLAN traffic
** In a private subnet, in an Auto Scaling group, creates Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with Suricata software installed on it
** Associates the target group with the Auto Scaling group
* If TrafficMirrorTargetType=ENI:
** In a private subnet, in an Auto Scaling group, creates Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with Suricata software installed on it

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html[Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring^] 
is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic 
network interface of Amazon EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and 
monitoring appliances for:
* Content inspection
* Threat monitoring
* Troubleshooting

The security and monitoring appliances can be deployed as individual instances, or as a fleet of 
instances behind a Network Load Balancer with a UDP listener. Traffic Mirroring supports filters and 
packet truncation, so that you only extract the traffic of interest to monitor by using monitoring 
tools of your choice. 

You can use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/tm-example-open-source.html[open-source tool] 
like https://suricata.io/[Suricata^] or https://zeek.org/[Zeek^] to monitor network traffic from Amazon EC2 instances. 
These open-source tools support VXLAN decapsulation, and they can be used at scale to monitor VPC 
traffic. 
 
The Quick Start does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic. Refer to 
[Traffic Mirroring getting start guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-getting-started.html) 
for configuring VPC Traffic Mirroring.

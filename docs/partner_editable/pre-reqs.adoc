Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To
be able to log in to your instances, you must create a key pair. On Linux, the key pair is
used to authenticate SSH login.

==== Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance type

Suricata is an open source Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
and Network Security Monitoring (NSM) engine. 

You might want to use single target for multiple sources. In doing so target can become resource constrained. 
You need to benchmark your performance to appropriately select and size your EC2 instance running Suricata.

You can also horizontally scale EC2 instances running Suricata by front ending them with a network load balancer (NLB) 
and use NLB as a target instead.

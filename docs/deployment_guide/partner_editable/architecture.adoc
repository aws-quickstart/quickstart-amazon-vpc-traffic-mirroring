.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/vpc-traffic-mirroring-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
 ** EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group used for deploying across two Availability Zones, offering high availability.
 ** A Network Load Balancer to balance traffic between the EC2 instances. For limited scale deployments, you can skip the Network Load Balancer setup and work directly with Suricata deployed on a single Amazon Linux 2 instance by choosing `TrafficMirrorTargetType` as `ENI` and `NumTargetEC2Instances` as `1`.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

NOTE: This Partner Solution does not configure VPC Traffic Mirroring. For information about configuring Traffic Mirroring to monitor your network traffic, see the
